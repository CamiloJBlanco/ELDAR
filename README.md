## About the project project

_1. The button adds person to the "Possible guests" list by default, BUT you can choose to move the user to "Confirmed guests"._

_2. Each person on the "Possible guests" list and on the "Confirmed guests" list can be modified._

_3. Each person can be removed from each list._

_4. I chose not to drag people from "Possible guests" list to "Confirmed guests" list, because using the checkbox can move multiple people at the same time (which was considered convenient for a guest list)._
